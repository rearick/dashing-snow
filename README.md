This project is currently is currently in proof of concept and can therefore be considered pre-alpha. The motivation for this effort is to address the dismal offering respresented by ServiceNow's native reporting capabilites. The non-interactive dashboard concept is intended for large 1080p call center displays and is anticipated to be one part of a comprehensive suite of support center performance monitoring tools.


### Standardized Development Environment
To maximize the possiblity of long-term success, the first priority before beginning any development was to ensure the development environment is easily replicated to encourage and facilitate group collaboration efforts. Thanks to [Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com), [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads), [git](https://git-scm.com/), and [Github](https://github.com/), this requirement has been met, and anyone wishing to begin making contributions to this effort should be able to get up and running in short order and with relative ease.

### Automated Data Transport/Forwarding
Before going any further, the reader is cautioned not to look directly at the inherent "hackiness" of the project's current state. Bear in mind this is a _proof of concept_ at the moment.
